# EZ Chords Pro
![rmbanner](https://github.com/jrussellrivers/myportfolio/blob/master/images/portfolio/ezchordspro.png)

## Overview:
This app was developed as a tool for aspiring pianists. When someone inputs a chord progression into the form on the site, a keyboard renders for each chord to show how to play it. The first chord input in the form takes a starting melody note from that chord and then the other chord inversions are calculated to provide you with a solution that minimizes hand movement from one chord to another. I hope this tool can be of use to musicians of all skill levels!

## Directions for use:
1. Choose the number of chords you want in your progression by pressing the "Add Chord" and "Remove Chord" buttons.
2. Input the note, variation, and starting melody for the first chord.
3. Input the notes and variations for the remaining chords.
4. Press Submit!
5. The section marked "Chord Progression" lists the entire progression.
  - Press the play button to hear the entire chord progression.
  - The time between chords is set to 1 second as default.
  - To change the amount of time between chords, press the "Increase Time" or "Reduce Time" buttons to increase/decrease the time, respectively.
6. Each chord in the progression has a keyboard with the proper fingering shown.
  - The chord name is displayed as well as each note in the order that they are fingered.
  - Clicking the play button here will play the single chord one time.
7. To load a new chord progression, simply follow these same steps and press submit. Happy learning!
